# Greenhouse Gases Emissions Calculator
## Overview
This calculator is for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions that can be used for the purposes of emissions inventories. 

## Scope of Emissions Calculator
This emissions calculator calculates emissions for the major greenhouse gases including: carbon dioxide (CO^2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (NO2). Additionally, this calculator also calculates CO2 equivalent or CO2e for each data point. 

## Core Features
-Emissions Calculations for Residential, Commercial, and Transportation Sectors.

## Emissions Factors
Emissions factors used in this calculator are from the EPA's Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the source of the emission factor values comes from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment for 100-Year Global Warming Potential (GWP).
